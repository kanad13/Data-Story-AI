## 4. Core Workflow

### Step 0: Session & Request Initialization

**On first run or when starting a new task:**

1. Run `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` to get the current timestamp
2. Create a new Request ID: `REQ-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
3. Log the new request and its ID in `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md`
4. Validate project environment and dependencies
5. Check for any pending tasks or incomplete work

**At the start of any subsequent session:**

1. Check `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md` for any incomplete work
2. If an incomplete task is found, summarize its status and ask the user whether to continue or start fresh
3. If continuing, pick up exactly where you left off with full context
4. If starting fresh, archive the old state and create a new Request ID
5. Verify project state and environment integrity

### Step 1: Explore and Research

- **Internal Knowledge Baseline**: Access your internal knowledge to establish a baseline understanding of the development requirements
- **Mandatory External Verification**: For any request requiring external information (libraries, APIs, best practices), you **must** perform a web search or use documentation tools to verify, challenge, and update your baseline knowledge. This step is not optional
- **Project Context Review**: Examine existing codebase, dependencies, and project structure
- **Synthesize**: Combine your internal knowledge with external search results and project context to form a complete understanding
- **Technical Feasibility**: Assess technical requirements, dependencies, and potential challenges
- **Summarize**: Document what you discovered in the scratchpad section of `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md`

### Step 2: Assess and Plan

- Evaluate task complexity to determine the necessary depth of planning
- Structure your plan with clear, actionable, and verifiable steps
- For complex or ambiguous tasks, use the `sequential-thinking` tool for structured reasoning and document your thought process
- **Create Detailed Implementation Plan** with:
  - Numbered checklist with time estimates
  - Dependencies and prerequisites for each step
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - Deliverables and success criteria
  - Testing and validation requirements
- Present the plan in `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md`

#### **Plan Approval Requirements**

- Present plan as numbered checklist with realistic time estimates
- Include risk assessment for each phase with mitigation strategies
- Specify concrete deliverables and measurable success criteria
- Highlight any assumptions or dependencies
- Request explicit **"APPROVED"** or **"MODIFY [specific changes]"** response
- **Crucially, wait for user confirmation before proceeding to implementation**
- Do not proceed until the user has explicitly approved the proposed steps

### Step 3: Implement

- Execute the approved plan systematically, working on one task at a time
- Update the status of each checklist item in `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md` as you progress
- Document key decisions, outcomes, and verification steps directly within the task log
- **Cite Your Sources**: Every sentence or data point taken from an external source (web search, documentation, file, etc.) **must** end with a citation
- For complex tasks, break down implementation into smaller, testable increments
- **Code Quality Standards**: Follow project coding standards and best practices
- **Testing Requirements**: Implement tests for all new functionality
- Explicitly verify the reasonableness and correctness of your solution at each major step
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track implementation time and resource usage

#### **Implementation Standards**

- Follow the project's coding standards (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)
- Write comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Document all configuration changes and dependencies
- Validate all external integrations and API calls
- Ensure security best practices are followed

### Step 4: Finalize and Document

- Ensure all acceptance criteria from the plan are met and verified
- **Code Quality Validation**: Run linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Testing Verification**: Execute all tests and ensure coverage requirements are met
- **Performance Validation**: Verify performance requirements are satisfied
- Clean up any temporary or scratch files created during the process
- Update all relevant documentation (READMEs, changelogs, API docs, code comments) with clear explanations of changes and their rationale
- **Security Review**: Validate security implications of changes
- Provide a final summary of:
  - Results achieved and features implemented
  - Lessons learned and technical insights
  - Performance metrics and benchmarks
  - Any recommended follow-up actions or improvements
  - Known limitations or areas for future enhancement
- Ensure all outputs are clear, well-formatted, and appropriate for the request
- For tasks that are primarily research or analysis, deliver the final output in a clean, dedicated file

## 5. Guiding Principles

1. **User-First**: Always confirm plans before performing significant work or making structural changes
2. **Iterative**: Decompose work into small, verifiable, and testable increments
3. **Quality-Focused**: Prioritize code quality, testing, and documentation over speed
4. **Security-Aware**: Consider security implications of all changes and implementations
5. **Performance-Conscious**: Monitor and optimize for performance throughout development
6. **Transparent**: Document decisions, progress, and outcomes clearly with rationale
7. **Verifiable**: All claims and information from external sources must be cited
8. **Practical**: Focus on delivering tangible value that meets project requirements
9. **Adaptive**: Adjust your approach based on new information, feedback, and changing requirements
10. **Standards-Compliant**: Follow established coding standards, best practices, and project conventions

## 6. Error Handling

**When you get blocked:**

1. Document the issue clearly in the current task log in `10-agent/03-task-state-tracker.md`
2. **Diagnostic Steps**: Perform systematic debugging and analysis
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Independently attempt up to two alternative approaches to resolve the issue
4. **Research Solutions**: Search for similar problems and solutions in documentation or community resources
5. **Escalation**: If still blocked after attempts, escalate to the user with:
   - Clear summary of what was attempted
   - Detailed description of the blocker with error messages
   - Analysis of potential root causes
   - Suggested next steps or alternative approaches
   - Impact assessment on overall project timeline

## 7. Project-Specific Guidelines

### **Development Environment**

- Always activate the virtual environment before starting work
- Verify all dependencies are installed and up-to-date
- Check environment variables are properly configured
- Validate database connectivity before starting LLM or UI work

### **Code Organization**

- Follow the established directory structure (10-agent/, 20-config/, etc.)
- Place new files in appropriate directories based on their function
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between modules
- Update imports and dependencies as needed

### **Testing Requirements**

- Write unit tests for all new functions and classes
- Include integration tests for complex workflows
- Test error handling and edge cases

### **Documentation Standards**

- Update README.md for any new features or setup changes
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Document configuration changes and environment requirements
- Add comments for complex business logic or algorithms
- Create examples and usage guides for new features

### **Performance Considerations**

- Profile code performance for database operations
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Monitor memory usage for large datasets
- Optimize query performance and database operations
- Test with realistic data volumes

### **Security Practices**

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Secure API keys and configuration secrets
- Regular dependency security scans

This workflow ensures systematic, high-quality development while maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the development process.
