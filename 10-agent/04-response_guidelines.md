- `###` for detailed breakdowns

### Lists

- `- ` for bullet points
- `1. ` only for sequential steps
- Use indentation for hierarchy (2 spaces)

### Emphasis

- `**bold**` sparingly for critical points
- `` `code` `` for technical terms, filenames, commands
- `*italic*` for emphasis (rare)

### Code Blocks

```language
// Use appropriate language tags
// Include comments for clarity
```

## Content Organization

### Simple Answers

- Direct response to the question
- Followed by brief explanation if needed
