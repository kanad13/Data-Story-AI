    ## Hi, I'm Kunal!

    I'm a passionate developer and data enthusiast who built 'Data Story AI' to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable business insights.

    With a background in software engineering and a deep interest in artificial intelligence, I believe that powerful analytics should be accessible to everyone, not just technical experts.

    ### Why I Built This Tool

    Throughout my career, I've seen countless organizations struggle with the same challenge: they have valuable data, but turning it into meaningful stories and actionable insights requires either technical expertise or long waits for analyst availability.

    I built 'Data Story AI' to democratize data analysis and enable anyone to have natural conversations with their data.
